9/27 - Changed the cursor to only be a pointer when you can click on something
     - Used Ajax to aynchronously submit the edit task modal form
     - The edit task modal form can update the task data, delete it, or cancel

     - Cleaned up the JQuery functions for modals, their values, and their buttons
     - Fixed the modal hide/show buttons

     - Removed the Django Allauth package

2/21 - Met with Roop and have the below changes to implement:
     - Move the menu and name link from the right to the left
     - Have only the name displayed on the task link
     - Clicking the score button should do something
     - Remove picture uploading/display
     - Remove description
     - In add/edit task put name first, followed by frequency, then importance, and category last
     - Clicking on a link will pull up stats such as due date, frequency, time remaining, smartracking, etc. with an edit button at the bottom that leads to the edit task pop-up
     - Add an acknowledge_total variable that keeps track of total acknowledges
     - Move the custom category and pre-made task options off to the menu

2/25 - Started to add a star system to show importance: 1 star = least; 5 stars = most
